# High-Level Design Document: Spring Boot 3.0.0 Migration

## Objective
The purpose of this high-level design document is to outline the approach for migrating an existing Spring Boot framework to version 3.0.0. The migration involves dual version support, accommodating Java and Kotlin interchangeability, and considering compatibility with JDK 17. Additionally, the document addresses API pattern support, such as MQ and HTTP connectivity.

## 1. **Assessment of Current Framework:**
   - Review existing codebase, dependencies, and API patterns.
   - Identify deprecated APIs and features.
   - Ensure compatibility with Spring Boot 3.0.0 prerequisites.

## 2. **Branching Strategy:**
   - Create separate branches for `spring-boot-2-java`, `spring-boot-2-kotlin`, `spring-boot-3-java`, and `spring-boot-3-kotlin`.
   - Develop new features and fixes in these branches according to the language and version.
   - Create additional branches for the latest minor and patch releases of Spring Boot 3.0.0.

## 3. **Conditional Compilation:**
   - Utilize conditional compilation or runtime checks for version-specific code.
   - Adapt language-specific features without maintaining a common codebase.
   - Ensure the code leverages features introduced in Spring Boot 3.0.0 and JDK 17.

## 4. **Version-Specific Configurations:**
   - Manage version-specific configurations through conditional annotations or property files.
   - Adjust property files or configuration classes based on the targeted Spring Boot version.

## 5. **Dependency Management:**
   - Handle version-specific dependencies using build tool profiles.
   - Declare dependencies for both versions and activate the relevant profiles during the build.
   - Regularly check for and update dependencies to the latest minor and patch releases within the Spring Boot 3.0.0 series.

## 6. **Continuous Integration:**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for each branch and language.
   - Ensure CI environment supports building for different Spring Boot versions, languages, and JDK 17.
   - Adjust build configurations to accommodate the latest minor and patch releases of Spring Boot 3.0.0.

## 7. **Separate Release Cycles:**
   - Plan separate release cycles for each branch, language, and API pattern.
   - Release updates and bug fixes independently for different versions, languages, and patterns.
   - Align release cycles with the latest minor and patch releases of Spring Boot 3.0.0.

## 8. **Documentation:**
   - Clearly document version-specific configurations, language requirements, and API pattern usage.
   - Update README files and documentation to guide users on selecting the appropriate version, language, and API pattern.
   - Include information on the latest minor and patch releases of Spring Boot 3.0.0.

## 9. **Test Coverage:**
    - Maintain comprehensive test coverage for each Spring Boot version, language, and API pattern.
    - Implement separate test suites for Java and Kotlin implementations.
    - Design specific test cases for MQ and HTTP patterns.
    - Update tests to cover features introduced in the latest minor and patch releases of Spring Boot 3.0.0.

## 10. **API Pattern Support:**
    - For MQ Connectivity (Shared among MQ libraries):
       - Create separate branches for MQ-related changes in each version and language.
       - Test MQ connectivity thoroughly for both versions and languages.

    - For HTTP Connectivity (Shared among HTTP libraries):
       - Create separate branches for HTTP-related changes in each version and language.
       - Test HTTP connectivity thoroughly for both versions and languages.

## 11. **Common Libraries (Shared among API Patterns):**
    - Identify common libraries used across different API patterns (e.g., logging, HTTP context).
    - Ensure these libraries are compatible with both Spring Boot versions, languages, and API patterns.
    - Update common libraries to versions supporting the latest minor and patch releases of Spring Boot 3.0.0.

## 12. **Backport Critical Fixes:**
    - In case of critical bug fixes or security patches, backport them to relevant branches, considering both versions, languages, and API patterns.

## 13. **Monitoring and Feedback:**
    - Monitor usage and gather feedback from users on different versions, languages, and API patterns.
    - Use this feedback to make informed decisions about future developments and deprecations.

## 14. **Deprecation Plan:**
    - Outline a deprecation plan for older versions, languages, and API patterns once migration is complete.
    - Communicate clearly to users about the future phase-out of support for older versions, languages, and API patterns.

This high-level design document provides a structured approach for migrating to Spring Boot 3.0.0, ensuring compatibility with the latest JDK, accommodating both Java and Kotlin, and supporting various API patterns with flexibility and maintainability. The outlined strategy covers version control, continuous integration, documentation, testing, and monitoring for a successful migration process.
